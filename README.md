My project is a web application for a computer hardware store, developed using modern web development technologies. The application allows users to view the range of computers

My system is database driven and we use EF Core and SQL to store and manage product, order and customer information. The application is implemented in the CRUD (create, read, update, delete) format, which allows you to easily manage data.

One of the unique aspects of our application is the use of machine learning using ML.NET to calculate computer performance. This allows our users to gain insight into how their chosen configuration affects performance, which helps them make informed purchases.

List of technologies (stack):
ASP.NET Core MVC 8 ,
HTML/CSS ,
JavaScript ,
Razor ,
EF Core ,
SQL ,
ML.NET.
